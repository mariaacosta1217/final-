					<p>The first polls close at 6 p.m., Eastern time, and the last closes seven hours later in Alaska. Here is when last voting finishes in each area and what to watch each hour as the vote counting begins.</p>

					<p>[Follow our live updates throughout the day and get live election results tonight. Here’s how, when and where to vote today.] </p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img1" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/1st%20map%20.png">

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH Keep an eye on the most watched race in Kentucky: the Sixth Congressional District, where Amy McGrath, a former Marine, is trying to unseat a male Republican incumbent. This race is likely to provide an early glimpse into whether the so-called blue wave is on. The big prize in Indiana is the Senate race, where Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, is trying to hold on to his seat. </p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img2" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/2nd%20map%20.png ">

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH The critical contests closing at this hour include a hotly contested governor’s race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp in Georgia, and races for governor and a Senate seat in Florida. With a focus on the Fifth, Seventh and 10th Congressional Districts in Virginia, Democrats are hoping the state will launch them into a dream scenario, where the control of the House is virtually settled before 8 p.m. Eastern. </p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img3" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/3rd%20map%20.png">


	

					<p>WHAT TO WATCH In Ohio, the 12th Congressional District remains the Democrats’ best hope for a House pickup in the state. North Carolina has several swing districts, and in West Virginia, Senator Joe Manchin — once considered an endangered incumbent— is now a front-runner, particularly after becoming the lone Democrat to support Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.</p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img4" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/4th%20map%20.png">

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH By this time, voters in more than half of the states will have cast their ballots, and polls will have closed in a number of high-profile races. One of the most talked-about races in the country — and among the most expensive — is the Texas Senate race between Democratic candidate, Beto O’Rourke, and Ted Cruz, a Republican. </p>

					<p> Led by Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor candidate, Michigan’s almost all-female ticket is set to create big gains in state and federal races. Ms. Whitmer is one of the Democrats’ best hopes to win a governor’s seat in a state Mr. Trump won in 2016.  </p>

					<p> In Tennessee, Taylor Swift’s endorsement of two Democrats has added excitement to a House and Senate race there. In Missouri, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, faces one of the nation’s toughest re-election races. </p>

					<p> In deeply blue New Jersey, Bob Menendez, the Democratic incumbent, is in an unexpectedly close race, partially fueled by ethics troubles. There are also critical House races in New Jersey, including the Republican-held Seventh Congressional District, one of Democrats’ prime targets. </p>

					<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH The only semi-competitive district is Arkansas’s Second District, which recently was in the news because of a controversial ad supporting French Hill, the Republican incumbent. Mr. Hill is favored to win.</p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img6" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/6th%20map%20.png">

			

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH Two women are vying for the open seat in Arizona vacated by Jeff Flake. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota is considered the most vulnerable Democrat. </p>
					
 

					<p> In Wisconsin, all eyes are on Scott Walker, who after years of seeming invincible, is facing his toughest re-election yet. Democrats are also hoping for a symbolic victory in the seat vacated by the retiring House speaker, Paul Ryan. </p>

					<p> In Minnesota, Republicans see an opportunity to flip a seat previously held by a Democrat in the First Congressional District. Republicans also have their eyes set on the attorney general race, where accusations of domestic abuse against Keith Ellison, the Democrat, has created an opening for his opponent. </p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img7" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/7th%20map.png">

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH Important Senate races dominate this collection of states: Senator Dean Heller, a Republican, faces a tough re-election in Nevada. </p>

					<p> Expect results from these races to trickle in. The fate of the House may well be decided at this point in the night. </p>

					<p>Democrats are also eyeing Iowa’s Fourth Congressional District, where Representative Steve King has repeatedly drawn rebuke by supporting white nationalists and neo-Nazi sympathizers on Twitter.</p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img8" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/8th%20map%20.png">



					<p> WHAT TO WATCH If control of the House comes down to California, you may as well go to sleep. The notoriously slow-counting state has multiple swing districts, and it allows mail-in ballots all the way until Election Day. If the races are close, this could lead to high drama. </p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img9" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/9th%20map.png">

					

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH A governor’s race in Alaska surprisingly became competitive after Bill Walker, the independent incumbent, dropped out and endorsed the Democrat, Senator Mark Begich. The race had been a close three-way battle, but now that it’s just Democrat versus Republican, the seat is up for grabs.</p>
					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img10" src= "file:///Users/mariaacosta/Downloads/newsiteproject/10th%20map%20.png">

					<p> WHAT TO WATCH Voting will have been completed in all states. </p>

					<blockquote> “When to Expect Results
					
					There’s a difference between when polls close and when races are called. Ballots have to be counted, and some counties are notoriously slow. Most election night experts believe the first swing races will be called around 10 p.m., Eastern time. Though some trends may be apparent earlier in the evening, do not expect an answer on which party has won the House until after 11 p.m. Eastern.” </blockquote>
